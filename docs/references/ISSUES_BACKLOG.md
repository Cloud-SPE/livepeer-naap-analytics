# Issues Backlog

Canonical backlog for unresolved feature ideas, design hardening, and engineering improvements.

## Scope and Usage

- Source of truth for open issues discovered in architecture, data contract, quality, and consolidation docs.
- Keep items implementation-oriented and traceable to source docs.
- When closing an item, update this file and the linked canonical doc in the same PR.

## Prioritization Scale

- `P0`: blocks correctness or release readiness.
- `P1`: high-value reliability or contract hardening.
- `P2`: useful enhancement; not release-blocking.
- `P3`: maintenance/documentation/process improvement.

## Canonical Backlog

| ID | Priority | Area | Item | Why It Matters | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BACKLOG-001` | `P0` | Metrics telemetry | Add true orchestrator transport bandwidth telemetry path (up/down), then model it in facts/rollups. | Current KPI is blocked; capacity and network analysis remain incomplete. | `docs/data/SCHEMA_AND_METRIC_CONTRACTS.md`, `docs/architecture/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md`, `docs/references/METRICS_SCHEMA_DESIGN_SCRATCHPAD.md` |
| `BACKLOG-002` | `P0` | Time semantics | Harden timestamp-domain policy for cross-component latency and edge ordering, explicitly covering (a) runner vs gateway clock drift/skew and (b) late/out-of-order gateway trickle delivery; expose dual-time semantics where required. | Prevents invalid mixed-domain arithmetic, false edge ordering, and misleading latency conclusions under skewed clocks or delayed event arrival. | `docs/data/SCHEMA_AND_METRIC_CONTRACTS.md`, `docs/architecture/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md`, `docs/references/METRICS_SCHEMA_DESIGN_SCRATCHPAD.md` |
| `BACKLOG-003` | `P1` | SLA contract | Lock SLA scoring contract: numerators/denominators, window policy, thresholds, and minimum coverage validity rules. | Ensures SLA scores are stable, comparable, and audit-ready. | `docs/data/SCHEMA_AND_METRIC_CONTRACTS.md`, `docs/architecture/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md`, `docs/references/METRICS_SCHEMA_DESIGN_SCRATCHPAD.md` |
| `BACKLOG-004` | `P1` | Lifecycle observability | Add Flink lifecycle counters/gauges for matching quality, out-of-order signals, and coverage emission quality. | Improves operational confidence and shortens incident triage. | `docs/data/SCHEMA_AND_METRIC_CONTRACTS.md`, `docs/references/METRICS_SCHEMA_DESIGN_SCRATCHPAD.md` |
| `BACKLOG-005` | `P1` | Data quality gates | Define and enforce release-gate thresholds for unmatched edges, freshness lag, and rollup parity; lock alert execution path. | Makes readiness checks objective and automatable. | `docs/data/SCHEMA_AND_METRIC_CONTRACTS.md`, `docs/references/METRICS_SCHEMA_DESIGN_SCRATCHPAD.md` |
| `BACKLOG-006` | `P1` | Ingest metrics | Add ingest-leg rollups (jitter/latency/bytes) after finalizing API contract fields. | Closes visibility gap between startup path and ingest transport behavior. | `docs/data/SCHEMA_AND_METRIC_CONTRACTS.md`, `docs/references/METRICS_SCHEMA_DESIGN_SCRATCHPAD.md` |
| `BACKLOG-007` | `P2` | Serving model | Add metadata-only GPU inventory serving view (`v_api_gpu_inventory_current`). | Improves inventory visibility without expensive repeated joins. | `docs/data/SCHEMA_AND_METRIC_CONTRACTS.md`, `docs/references/METRICS_SCHEMA_DESIGN_SCRATCHPAD.md` |
| `BACKLOG-008` | `P2` | Serving model | Add optional enriched convenience view (`v_api_gpu_metrics_enriched`). | Simplifies consumer queries when joined metadata is required frequently. | `docs/data/SCHEMA_AND_METRIC_CONTRACTS.md`, `docs/references/METRICS_SCHEMA_DESIGN_SCRATCHPAD.md` |
| `BACKLOG-009` | `P2` | Serving model | Audit and migrate external demand consumers for model-aware demand grain (`v_api_network_demand` now keyed by `(hour,gateway,region,pipeline,model_id)`). Add compatibility query snippets/examples for pipeline-grain consumers. | Prevents downstream join inflation and interpretation drift in clients that still assume pipeline-only demand keys. | `docs/data/SCHEMA_AND_METRIC_CONTRACTS.md`, `docs/quality/TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md`, `docs/references/METRICS_SCHEMA_DESIGN_SCRATCHPAD.md` |
| `BACKLOG-010` | `P2` | Lineage | Preserve and harden per-session canonical orchestrator lineage queryability by adding explicit swap lineage fields and validation checks (including previous/next orchestrator transitions) in lifecycle facts/views. | Supports deterministic swap forensics and reduces ambiguity in multi-hop session transitions now that baseline session identity exists. | `docs/data/SCHEMA_AND_METRIC_CONTRACTS.md`, `docs/references/METRICS_SCHEMA_DESIGN_SCRATCHPAD.md` |
| `BACKLOG-011` | `P2` | Flink maintainability | Refactor pipeline assembly into focused topology builders while preserving behavior. | Reduces regression risk and improves reviewability of pipeline changes. | `docs/reports/JAVA_CODEBASE_ASSESSMENT.md` |
| `BACKLOG-012` | `P2` | Flink maintainability | Split monolithic sink mapper surface into domain-focused mapper modules. | Lowers schema-drift risk and makes mapping evolution safer. | `docs/reports/JAVA_CODEBASE_ASSESSMENT.md` |
| `BACKLOG-013` | `P1` | Testing | Complete integration enforcement for latency and demand-attribution invariants by running API-readiness assertions in the default integration harness and adding explicit failure thresholds for drift/parity. | Some invariants exist, but they are not fully enforced in the primary run path, leaving regression risk for API-facing metrics. | `docs/reports/JAVA_CODEBASE_ASSESSMENT.md`, `docs/quality/TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md` |
| `BACKLOG-014` | `P2` | Contract docs | Add semantic Javadocs for API-facing KPI fields and attribution fields (units/nullability/invariants). | Reduces implementation ambiguity and onboarding cost. | `docs/reports/JAVA_CODEBASE_ASSESSMENT.md` |
| `BACKLOG-015` | `P3` | Docs automation | Add CI checks for markdown linting and local-link validation. | Prevents doc drift and broken navigation. | `docs/references/DOC_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md` |
| `BACKLOG-016` | `P3` | Docs governance | Add freshness metadata (owner + last-reviewed date) to canonical docs. | Clarifies ownership and review cadence. | `docs/references/DOC_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md` |
| `BACKLOG-017` | `P3` | PR guardrails | Add automated check that schema changes co-update mappers, tests, and canonical docs in one PR. | Enforces contract discipline and reduces partial changes. | `docs/references/DOC_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md` |
| `BACKLOG-018` | `P1` | Flink observability | Configure and validate a production metrics reporter (for example Prometheus/JMX) so JobManager/TaskManager and pipeline metrics are exported. | Prevents blind spots during incident response and enables SLO-backed alerting. | `docs/operations/RUNBOOKS_AND_RELEASE.md`, `docs/quality/TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md` |
| `BACKLOG-019` | `P2` | Flink config hygiene | Replace deprecated Flink keys and submission paths (`restart-strategy` -> `restart-strategy.type`, REST query-param submission -> JSON body flow). | Reduces upgrade risk and avoids behavior drift on future Flink releases. | `docs/operations/RUNBOOKS_AND_RELEASE.md`, `docs/workflows/ENGINEERING_WORKFLOW.md` |
| `BACKLOG-020` | `P1` | Flink serialization | Remove `GenericType` fallbacks in hot/stateful paths by introducing explicit Flink type information/serializers for warned fields (for example `KafkaInboundRecord#headers`, `CapabilitySnapshotBucket#byModelKey`). | Improves runtime performance and state schema evolution safety. | `docs/quality/TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md`, `docs/workflows/ENGINEERING_WORKFLOW.md` |
| `BACKLOG-021` | `P2` | Namespace consistency | Replace `com.livepeer` package names across code and configs with the chosen canonical namespace, including build/runtime references. | Reduces coupling to legacy naming, avoids config/package drift, and simplifies future refactors/releases. | `docs/workflows/ENGINEERING_WORKFLOW.md`, `docs/references/ISSUES_BACKLOG.md` |
| `BACKLOG-022` | `P1` | Lifecycle contract correctness | Resolve `pipeline` vs `model_id` semantic drift in gold/session data. Today some lifecycle outputs store model-like values in `pipeline`, while true pipeline (`live-video-to-video`) is not present in stream events and is only available via `network_capabilities` attribution context. Normalization currently depends on joining signal hot-wallet identity to `network_capabilities.local_address`, then projecting canonical `orchestrator_address` plus pipeline/model context from the matched capability snapshot. Define canonical field semantics, update Flink attribution/state emission to preserve both dimensions correctly, and add assertions that prevent regression. | Prevents incorrect aggregation grain, broken scenario matching, and misleading API/query outputs caused by conflating model and pipeline dimensions. | `docs/data/SCHEMA_AND_METRIC_CONTRACTS.md`, `docs/quality/TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md`, `docs/architecture/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` |
| `BACKLOG-023` | `P1` | Attribution resilience | Add a production-grade attribution fallback and quality policy for sessions where runtime stream events show an orchestrator but canonical capability mapping is missing in-window. Define: (1) bounded mapping fallback window for hot-wallet -> canonical resolution (for example +/-24h), (2) attribution source labeling (`direct`, `mapped_window`, `unattributed`), (3) data-quality KPIs and alert thresholds for unattributed-session rate, and (4) deterministic backfill workflow when late `network_capabilities` events arrive. Keep gold metrics strict by default (no guessed attribution), but make fallback/backfill behavior explicit and testable. | Real-world event timing skew, late capabilities, or missing mapping evidence can leave valid sessions unattributed in GPU/session drilldowns and serving views. A clear policy prevents silent metric gaps, improves operability, and keeps attribution semantics auditable. | `docs/data/SCHEMA_AND_METRIC_CONTRACTS.md`, `docs/quality/TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md`, `docs/operations/RUNBOOKS_AND_RELEASE.md`, `docs/architecture/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` |
| `BACKLOG-024` | `P1` | Enrichment ordering | Execute a phased capability-enrichment ordering hardening plan: keep strict parity guardrails, preserve unbiased replay fixtures by default, move status enrichment ownership to Flink, and add bounded late-capability correction semantics; include explicit test-pack and notebook diagnostics alignment. | Closes a correctness gap where insert-time enrichment can leave empty keys and cause rollup/view divergence during replay or out-of-order delivery, while keeping validation and reader diagnostics clear. | `docs/workflows/CAPABILITY_ENRICHMENT_ORDERING_PLAN.md`, `docs/quality/TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md`, `tests/integration/sql/assertions_pipeline.sql` |
| `BACKLOG-025` | `P1` | Database performance | Implement a ClickHouse optimization pack for serving/query scalability: (1) materialize and reuse latest-session snapshots (replace repeated `argMax(..., version)` scans in API views), (2) add targeted `event_id` skip indexes for DLQ/quarantine forensic lookups, (3) reassess `stream_trace_events` sort key for time-window-first workloads, and (4) remove non-DDL backfill/ad-hoc query statements from schema bootstrap path. | Prevents recurring full-table aggregation work in serving views, improves incident-triage query latency on failure tables, and reduces bootstrap/runtime overhead as data volume grows. | `configs/clickhouse-init/01-schema.sql`, `docs/architecture/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md`, `docs/quality/TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md` |
| `BACKLOG-026` | `P2` | SLA contract | Evaluate extending SLA scoring with latency and FPS quality signals. **Design note:** this is explicitly not final; keep current SLA semantics unchanged and revisit once SLA scoring requirements (SLO thresholds, weights, denominator policy, and grain/rollup rules) are finalized. | Captures an important product need (latency/FPS in SLA) without introducing premature contract drift or grain-splitting regressions before requirements are clear. | `docs/data/SCHEMA_AND_METRIC_CONTRACTS.md`, `docs/quality/TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md`, `docs/references/METRICS_SCHEMA_DESIGN_SCRATCHPAD.md` |
